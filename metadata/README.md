Metadata and Attribute Annotations

This directory contains structured medical attribute annotations and intermediate semantic extraction outputs used in the construction of MM-NeuroOnco.

File Overview
1️⃣ Semantic Extraction Subset
step1_supplement_ready.json

A curated subset (~20,000 samples)

Used as input for automated medical semantic extraction

Represents a structured indexing subset of the full dataset

Contains no original imaging data

2️⃣ Dual-Model Silver Annotations
silver_label_extract_run_a.json

Attributes extracted independently by Model A.

silver_label_extract_run_b.json

Attributes extracted independently by Model B.

These two files represent parallel semantic extraction results before filtering or fusion.

3️⃣ High-Precision Fused Silver Labels
Fused_Silver_Labels_HIGH_PRECISION.json

Generated by cross-validating outputs from Model A and Model B

Designed to prioritize precision over recall

Removes inconsistent or low-confidence attributes

This file serves as the high-confidence intermediate annotation set.

4️⃣ Final Gold Standard Annotations
Final_Gold_Standard_CLEAN.json

Produced after a third multimodal model performs visual review and quality control

Represents the final cleaned and quality-controlled attribute annotations

Used for benchmark construction and evaluation

This is the most reliable structured attribute file in this directory.

Full Dataset-Level Metadata

The complete dataset-level metadata files are large and therefore hosted separately on Hugging Face:

👉 https://huggingface.co/datasets/gfnnnb/MM-NeuroOnco-Images

These include:

all_brain_tumor_metadata.json

all_brain_tumor_metadata_rich.json

These files contain de-identified indexing and semantic mapping information only.
